## ðŸ’¡ About the project

You will learn how to open, read and close files on an OS.
This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.

## ðŸ“‹ Testing

You only have to edit the get_next_line.c file and uncomment the main function and headers inside it.
You can edit test.txt files to put another text if you wish to test othe cases.
Then simply run this command (change "xx" with desired buffer size) :

```shell
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c && ./a.out
```

Or you can also use this third party tester to fully test the project
